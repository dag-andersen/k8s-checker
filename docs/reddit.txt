Kubernetes YAML Linter for vscode?
What do you use for linting your Kubernetes YAML files in vscode?
I have found a vscode extension called Kubernetes-reference-highlighter that highlights references to other resources if it finds them in your local workspace, on a running cluster, or in the output of resources generated by Kustomize.

It is not perfect, but I think it works quite well. The extension is fairly new, so I thought I would share it here.

In my experience, it often happens that a reference is broken in my YAML because one of the referenced objects is placed in the wrong namespace by mistake. Here, Kubernetes-reference-highlighter is very useful in catching dangling references to other resources in my YAML files.

Another great tool is KubeLinter which checks for a lot of helpful stuff, including dangling references. This is nice, but it is a command-line tool, so I don't get live feedback in my editor.

So, my question is, what do you use for linting your Kubernetes YAML files in vscode?
Are there any even better tools for highlighting references that I just don't know about?
